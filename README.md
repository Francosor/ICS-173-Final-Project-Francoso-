# ICS-173-Final-Project-Francoso-


This project involves a retrospective approach. I used the source https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/reports-statistics/us-pet-ownership-statistics. And focused mainly on the percentage of households owning this specific companion animal. These animals ranged from dogs, cats, birds, and horses. In the statistical data source, there was a lot of other data. These included the different number of households owning that specific type of animal. As well as, the average number of owned per household, total number within the United States, etc. In this project, two different data visualizations are displayed. Specifically, a pie chart and a bar chart with raw data were also provided. Thus, to go into more depth â€¦ Python Pandas were utilized for data manipulation. While Matplotlib was used for data visualization. 

Steps to ensure coding ran smoothly:

1. Ensure Python is installed correctly. 
2. Install required Python packages: Matplotlib and Pandas. 
3. Organize code with a clear structure.
4. Look at data and import it into the dataset.
5. Write code and ensure there are no errors.
6. Run units to test and verify the correctness of the different components with code.
7. Lastly, confirm the code is correct. You can do this by looking over graphs and seeing if they are displayed accurately. 

Mahalo!!
